title: "HackHours 2025"
---

These stand-alone sessions are meant for more advanced coders to learn a specific package, method, or toolset with a focus on ocean data access in Python and R. We will be using the NOAA Fisheries Openscapes JupyterHub and you will not need to install anything.  [About the HackHours](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAAHackDays/content/hackhours.html)

**When:** Fridays 11am Pacific/2pm Eastern. **How do I get access?** Click here for [Video Link and JupyterHub Access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Wu28DGDKNsdQmW5yuFd3JJuUSn91HFxCEb3dqPxYcs/edit?usp=sharing) (NOAA only)
