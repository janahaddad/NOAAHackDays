## Summary

Once we have a `terra` SpatRaster, there are many things we can do with it like aggregation, sampling, means and interpolation. 

We will use the [GHRSST Level 4 AVHRR_OI Global Blended Sea Surface Temperature Analysis](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2036881712-POCLOUD.html) data from NCEI. It is lower resolution than the MUR data and will load faster. 

## Prerequisites

The tutorial can be run with the guest Earthdata Login that is in `earthdatalogin`. However, if you will be using the NASA Earthdata portal more regularly, please register for an Earthdata Login account. Please <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov> to register and manage your Earthdata Login account. This account is free to create and only takes a moment to set up.

See the [1-earthdatalogin](1-earthdatalogin.html) tutorial for set-up if you are running the tutorial locally.

## Load Required Packages

```{r message=FALSE}
library(earthdatalogin)
library(lubridate)
library(terra)
```

## Get a vector of urls to our nc files

Authenticate.

```{r}
earthdatalogin::edl_netrc() 
```

Get the urls. The `results` object is a vector of urls pointing to our `netCDF` files in the cloud. Each `netCDF` file is circa 670Mb.

```{r results_MUR}
short_name <- 'MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1'
bbox <- c(xmin=-75.5, ymin=33.5, xmax=-73.5, ymax=35.5) 
tbox <- c("2020-01-16", "2020-12-16")

results <- earthdatalogin::edl_search(
  short_name = short_name,
  version = "4.1",
  temporal = tbox, 
  bounding_box = paste(bbox,collapse=",")
)
length(results)
results[1:3]
```

## Crop and plot one netCDF file

Each MUR SST `netCDF` file is large so I do not want to download. Instead I will use `terra::rast()` to do subset the data on the server side. `vsi = TRUE` is letting function know that these are files in the cloud and to use GDAL functionality for that type of resource.

```{r get_one_MUR}
ras <- terra::rast(results[1], vsi=TRUE)
```

Crop to a very small region. Note order of terms is different than in bbox!!

```{r crop_MUR}
e <- terra::ext(c(xmin=-75.5, xmax=-73.5,  ymin=33.5, ymax=35.5 ))
rc <- terra::crop(ras, e)
rc
```

Plot:

```{r plot_MUR}
plot(rc[[c(1, 2)]])
```

## Crop and plot multiple netCDF files

We can send multiple urls to `terra`.

```{r get_four_MUR}
ras_all <- terra::rast(results[c(1:4)], vsi = TRUE)
ras_all
```

Crop to a small extent. Note order of terms is different than in bbox! Since we will only plot sst for this example, it is faster to first select our variable of interest.

```{r crop_four_MUR}
e <- terra::ext(c(xmin=-75.5, xmax=-73.5,  ymin=33.5, ymax=35.5 ))
ras_sst <- ras_all["analysed_sst",]
rc_sst <- terra::crop(ras_sst, e)
rc_sst
```

Convert Kelvin to Celsius.

```{r}
rc_sst <- rc_sst - 273.15
```

Now plot. We will set the range so it is the same across plots and clean up the titles to be just day without time.

```{r plot_four_MUR}
titles <- terra::time(x = rc_sst) |> lubridate::date() |> as.character()
plot(rc_sst, 
     range = c(16, 26),
     main = titles)
```

## Conclusions

Some really cool things just happened here! You connected to multiple remote-sensing files (`netCDF`) in the cloud and worked with them without directly downloading them.
