You are welcome to use the JupyterHub outside of the HackHours and workshops in order to facilitate
your data science and cloud-computing learning. Here are some ideas:

## Python

* Udemy, Coursera, and DataCamp are popular platforms that have data science courses. 
  - I did Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp in Udemy
* The same have deep-learning and ML courses
* Harvard https://pll.harvard.edu/catalog and MIT https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=python have lots of free material
* Geosciences
